## Overview

**Project Title**:  
Hangman Console Game (Kotlin)

**Project Description**:  
This is a console-based Hangman game written in Kotlin. The game selects a random word from a predefined list and allows the player to guess letters one at a time. The player wins if they guess all letters before running out of allowed incorrect guesses.

**Project Goals**:  
- Practice fundamental Kotlin concepts including variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.  
- Build a fully functioning terminal-based game from scratch.  
- Improve code readability and modularity with good software design practices.

### Instructions for using the software:

1. Launch the game from the terminal.
2. A random word will be selected.
3. Guess one letter at a time by typing and pressing Enter.
4. You will be told if your guess is correct or incorrect.
5. Win by guessing all the letters before running out of lives!

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- Kotlin 1.9+  
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 11 or higher  
- IntelliJ IDEA (optional, for Kotlin development)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ ] Add support for difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)  
- [ ] Track and display player's score across multiple rounds  
- [ ] Implement a GUI version using JavaFX or Compose for Desktop  
- [ ] Add unit tests for core game logic  
- [ ] Store guessed words and game history in a file
